# gosmatch
Reimplementation and correction of GOSMatch based on it official codes

# test the consistency with the original matlab codes
The original repo is [here](https://github.com/zhuyachen/GOSMatch.git). I made a clone
inside [GOSMatch_origin](GOSMatch_origin) folder. To get the data, clone the original 
repo, and uncompress the data to `data/00` folder.

* run `origin_gosmatch.py` to check the consistency of python version code reimplemented myself
with the original matlab codes.

# check the simplified and corrected version
in `origin_gosmatch.py`, I added comments for the corrected codes for the comparison.
